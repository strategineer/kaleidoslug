        Wow! You're the Grand Champion! I saw your fight against the Gray Prince! You're the best! Can I... Can I follow you around? I won't get in the way!~
        By Azura, by Azura, by Azura! It's the Grand Champion! I can't believe it's you! Standing here! Next to me!~
        Yes, oh great and mighty Grand Champion? Is there something you need? Can I carry your weapon? Shine your boots? Backrub, perhaps?
