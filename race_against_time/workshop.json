  "Title": "Race Against Time",
  "Description": "Race against the clock!\n\nYou've got a limited amount of real time to get as far as possible in your run.\n\nInspired by Rogue Rat's (https://www.youtube.com/@Rogue_Rat) daily runs where he limits himself to playing 1 hour to get as many points as he can.\n\nThe mod defaults to being enabled only for daily runs (configurable) with a 1 hour time limit (configurable), with warnings every 15 minutes (configurable) and with the timer running out leading to the character's death (configurable).\n\nLet me know if you find any bugs!",
